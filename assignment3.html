					1985 MOVE bombing
					<br>
					<span style="font-size:.6em;">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</span>

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>The 1985 MOVE bombing was the destruction by the Philadelphia Police Department of 61 residential homes in the West Philadelphia Osage Neighborhood during a standoff and firefight. One of the residential homes was occupied by the MOVE organization. Two explosive devices were dropped by a police helicopter on a bunker-like cubicle on the roof of the house, causing a fire which the Philadelphia Fire Department subsequently let burn out of control, destroying 61 previously evacuated
					   neighbouring houses over two city blocks, and leaving 250 people homeless.[1] Six adults and five children in the MOVE compound died in the attack, with one adult and one child surviving. A lawsuit in federal court found that the city used excessive force and violated constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure.

					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>In 1981, MOVE relocated to a row house at 6221 Osage Avenue in the Cobbs Creek area of West Philadelphia. Neighbors complained to the city for years about trash around their building, confrontations with neighbors, and bullhorn announcements of political messages by MOVE members.[3][4] The bullhorn was broken and inoperable for the three weeks prior to the police bombing of the row house.[4]
						<br>
					   The police obtained arrest warrants in 1985 charging four MOVE occupants with crimes including parole violations, contempt of court, illegal possession of firearms, and making terroristic threats.[5] Mayor Wilson Goode and police commissioner Gregore J. Sambor classified MOVE as a terrorist organization.[6] Police evacuated residents of the area from the neighborhood prior to their action. Residents were told that they would be able to return to their homes after a 24-hour
					   period.[7]

					<p>On Monday, May 13, 1985, nearly 500 police officers, along with city manager Leo Brooks, arrived in force and attempted to clear the building and execute the arrest warrants.[7][6] Water and electricity were shut off in order to force MOVE members out of the house. Commissioner Sambor read a long speech addressed to MOVE members that started with, "Attention MOVE: This is America. You have to abide by the laws of the United States." When the MOVE members did not respond, the police
					   decided to forcibly remove the people who remained in house,[7] which consisted of seven adults and six children.[8]

						<br>
					   There was an armed standoff with police,[9] who threw tear gas canisters at the building. The MOVE members fired at them, and a gunfight with semi-automatic and automatic firearms ensued.[10] Police used more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition before Commissioner Sambor ordered that the compound be bombed.[10] From a Pennsylvania State Police helicopter, Philadelphia Police Department Lt. Frank Powell proceeded to drop two 1.5-pound (0.75 kg) bombs (which the police referred to as
					   "entry devices"[6]) made of Tovex, a dynamite substitute, combined with two pounds of FBI-supplied C-4,[11] targeting a fortified, bunker-like cubicle on the roof of the house.[3]

						The ensuing fire killed 11 of the people in the house, six adults and five children: John Africa, Rhonda Africa, Theresa Africa, Frank Africa, Conrad Africa, Tree Africa, Delisha Africa, Netta Africa, Little Phil Africa, Tomaso Africa, and Raymond Africa.[12] Ramona Africa, one of the two MOVE survivors from the house, said that police fired at those trying to escape.[13]

						<p>
							Mayor Goode appointed an investigative commission called the Philadelphia Special Investigation Commission (PSIC, aka MOVE Commission), chaired by William H. Brown, III. Commissioner Sambor resigned in November 1985; in a speech the following year, he said that he was made a "surrogate" by Goode.[14]
							<br>
							<br>
							The MOVE Commission issued its report on March 6, 1986. The report denounced the actions of the city government, stating that dropping a bomb on an occupied row house was unconscionable.[15] Following the release of the report, Goode made a formal public apology.[16] No one from the city government was criminally charged in the attack. The only surviving adult MOVE member, Ramona Africa, refused to testify in court and was charged and convicted on charges of riot and conspiracy;
							she served seven years in prison.[17]
							<br>
							<br>
							Three lawsuits were filed against the city of Philadelphia including Louise James, administrator of the estate of Frank James in 1994; Ramona Africa in 1996; and Alfonso Leaphart, administrator of the estate of Vincent Leaphart.
							<br>
							<br>
							A lawsuit appealing a judgment against the police and public officials was filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on November 3, 1994 Africa v. City of Philadelphia (In re City of Philadelphia Litig.), 49 F.3d 945 (1995) and was decided on March 6, 1995. The court decided that the plaintiffs did not have a Fourth Amendment claim against the city because there was no seizure when the defendants dropped explosives in the plaintiffs buildings, city
							officials and police officers had qualified immunity under 42 U.S.C.S. ยง 1983, but the city did not have qualified immunity from liability despite its officials being exempt.[18]
							<br>
							<br>
							In 1996, a federal jury ordered the city to pay a $1.5 million civil suit judgment to survivor Ramona Africa and relatives of two people killed in the bombing. The jury had found that the city used excessive force and violated the members' constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure. Ramona was awarded $500,000 for the pain, suffering and physical harm suffered in the fire.[2] In 1985, Philadelphia was given the sobriquet "The City that Bombed
							Itself".[19][20]
							
							In 2005, federal judge Clarence Charles Newcomer presided over a civil trial brought by residents seeking damages for having been displaced by the widespread destruction following the 1985 police bombing of MOVE. A jury awarded them a $12.83 million verdict against the City of Philadelphia.[21]
							
							In November 2020, the Philadelphia City Council approved a resolution to formally apologize for the MOVE bombing. The measure also established an annual day of "observation, reflection and recommitment" on May 13, the anniversary of the bombing.[22][23]
